\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\ulnone\b\i\f0\fs44 Ans-1. A **Denial of Service (DoS) attack** is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. The primary goal of a DoS attack is to make a resource or service unavailable to its intended users, which can result in downtime, loss of revenue, or other negative impacts.\par
\par
### **How DoS Attacks Work**\par
\par
1. **Overloading Resources**: The attacker overwhelms the target system\rquote s resources, such as bandwidth, processing power, or memory, by sending an excessive amount of traffic or requests. This exhausts the system\rquote s capacity to handle legitimate requests.\par
\par
2. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Some DoS attacks exploit specific vulnerabilities in software or systems. By triggering these vulnerabilities, the attacker can cause the system to crash, freeze, or behave unexpectedly.\par
\par
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: The attack may target specific resources such as CPU, RAM, or storage, causing the system to become unresponsive or slow to respond.\par
\par
### **Common Types of DoS Attacks**\par
\par
1. **Volume-Based Attacks**: Aim to flood the target with a large amount of traffic, overwhelming its bandwidth.\par
   - **UDP Flood**: Sends a high volume of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets to random ports, consuming bandwidth and processing power.\par
   - **ICMP Flood**: Uses Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets to flood the target, often through ping requests, to overwhelm the network.\par
\par
2. **Protocol Attacks**: Exploit weaknesses in network protocols to disrupt service.\par
   - **SYN Flood**: Exploits the TCP handshake process by sending a flood of SYN requests, consuming resources and causing server overload.\par
   - **Ping of Death**: Sends oversized or malformed ping packets to exploit vulnerabilities in how the target handles such packets.\par
\par
3. **Application Layer Attacks**: Target specific applications or services, aiming to exhaust server resources.\par
   - **HTTP Flood**: Sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server, causing it to become overwhelmed and unable to process legitimate requests.\par
   - **Slowloris**: Keeps many connections to the target server open and idle, consuming server resources and preventing new connections.\par
\par
4. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**: Involve multiple systems (often part of a botnet) coordinated to launch the attack. This makes it harder to mitigate due to the distributed nature of the traffic.\par
\par
### **Impact of DoS Attacks**\par
\par
- **Service Disruption**: The targeted service or website becomes unavailable, leading to downtime.\par
- **Financial Loss**: Businesses can suffer financial losses due to interrupted services or loss of revenue.\par
- **Reputation Damage**: Frequent or prolonged outages can damage an organization's reputation and customer trust.\par
- **Resource Costs**: Additional costs may be incurred in mitigating the attack, such as investing in better security infrastructure.\par
\par
### **Mitigation Techniques**\par
\par
1. **Traffic Filtering**: Use security devices or services to filter out malicious traffic and allow only legitimate traffic to reach the target.\par
\par
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a given time frame.\par
\par
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed.\par
\par
4. **Redundancy and Failover**: Design systems with redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure continued availability in case of an attack.\par
\par
5. **Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: Utilize firewalls and IPS to detect and block malicious traffic.\par
\par
6. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Leverage CDNs to absorb and mitigate traffic, providing additional layers of protection.\par
\par
By understanding and implementing these strategies, organizations can better protect their resources from the disruptive effects of DoS attacks.\par
